The parser and lexer are built by ANTLR from the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antlr/grammars-v4/master/java8/Java8.g4][Java8.g4]] grammar already available in ANTLR's github repository.

Looking at the grammar itself, its main entry point is the "compilationUnit" rule:
  compilationUnit
    :  packageDeclaration? importDeclaration* typeDeclaration* EOF
    ;

JavaCSS needs to parse whole Java files as well as certain incomplete Java snippets. Initially, the above rule seems
