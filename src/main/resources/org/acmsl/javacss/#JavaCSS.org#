** Introduction
# PROPERTIES:
# +intro
JavaCSS is a toolset to simplify writing Java code.

Main benefits:
- Automation of the output style and conventions.
- Dependency management: import statement, pom.xml.

*** Parser

JavaCSS contains an ANTLR-based Java parser. It reads Java source code, and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
The parser and lexer are built by ANTLR from the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antlr/grammars-v4/master/java8/Java8.g4][Java8.g4]] grammar already available in ANTLR's github repository.

Looking at the grammar itself, its main entry point is the "compilationUnit" rule:
  compilationUnit
    :  packageDeclaration? importDeclaration* typeDeclaration* EOF
    ;

JavaCSS needs to parse whole Java files as well as certain incomplete Java snippets. Initially, the above rule seems to fit JavaCSS
requirements nicely.

*** Generator

The whole process consists of:
- parsing Java code
- generating an AST
- AST processing
- serializing the final AST

JavaCSS uses StringTemplate as generator tool. However, it currently lacks a mechanism to bind or associate templates to parts of the AST.
We'll refer to this feature as "template selectors".

** Prototype

*** Project setup

As with any other regular Java project, we'll start by investing some time in preparing the tool ecosystem:

- Create a new repository in github.
- Set up the folder structure expected by Maven.
- Write the initial Maven's pom.xml
- Create a new Jenkins job to listen to changes on the github repository.

*** First test

The simplest test is simple: we wa
